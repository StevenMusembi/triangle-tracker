Author: Steven Musembi 1/3/2019
A triangle-tracker will take sides of any object and tell if its a triangle or not. If its a triangle it will then determine if its equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

Description.

for example. If you enter same numbers like (3,3,3) the tracker will return equilateral.
if you enter (3,3,2) the return will be isosceles.
If you enter(2,3,4) the return will be scalene.
if you enter (3,4,300) the return will be "this is not a triangle".
